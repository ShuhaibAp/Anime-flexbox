    <p>
      A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
      nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves,is capable of-<br>
      possessing enough energy to escape it. Einstein's theory of general
      relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime-<br>
      to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event
      horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of-<br>
      an object crossing it, but it has no locally detectable features according
      to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal-<br>
      black body, as it reflects no light. Quantum field theory in curved
      spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the-<br>
      same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to
      its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin -<br>for
      stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
